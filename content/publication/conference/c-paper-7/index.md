abstract = "This paper presented the relationship between the world price of crude oil and oil related stocks over 2011:4-2011:6 is analysed by using a graphical computational correlation analysis method. The Operation Neptune Spear happened in 2011:5 may change nature of the price connection between oil and stock, we evaluate and rank the im- pact of crude oil for the period before and after the event respectively. Over the statistical results, we find that graphic correlation is superior to typical point-to-point distance calculation for correlation analysis; and we discover stock "
