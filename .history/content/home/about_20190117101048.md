# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate of machine learning at evolutionary computation research group (ECRG) of Victoria University of Wellington (from 2015 to present). My current research interests include reinforcement learning, deep learning, and evolutionary computation. From 2012 to 2015, I had been working as full-time research and teaching assistant in Unitec Institute of Technology with a focus on applying machine learning techniques to Cybersecurity domain. In 2011, I obtained my Master of Computer and Information Sciences degree from Auckland University of Technology with a research focus on Linear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition.
