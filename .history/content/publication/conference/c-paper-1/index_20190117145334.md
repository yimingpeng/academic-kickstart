abstract = "Training data in real world is often presented in
random chunks. Yet existing sequential Incremental IDR/QR
LDA (s-QR/IncLDA) can only process data one sample after
another. This paper proposes a constructive chunk Incremental IDR/QR LDA (c-QR/IncLDA) for multiple data samples
incremental learning. Given a chunk of s samples for incremental learning, the proposed c-QR/IncLDA increments current
discriminant model Ω, by implementing computation on the
compressed the residue matrix ∆ ∈ Rd×η
, instead of the
entire incoming data chunk Xf ∈ Rd×s
, where η ≤ s holds.
Meanwhile, we derive a more accurate reduced within-class
scatter matrix W to minimize the discriminative information
loss at every incremental learning cycle. It is noted that the
computational complexity of c-QR/IncLDA can be more expensive than s-QR/IncLDA for single sample processing. However,
for multiple samples processing, the computational efficiency of
c-QR/IncLDA deterministically surpasses s-QR/IncLDA when
the chunk size is large, i.e., s  η holds. Moreover, experiments
evaluation shows that the proposed c-QR/IncLDA can achieve
an accuracy level that is competitive to batch QR/LDA and is
consistently higher than s-QR/IncLDA."
