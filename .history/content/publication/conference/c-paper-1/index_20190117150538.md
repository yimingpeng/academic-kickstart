abstract = "Training data in real world is often presented in random chunks. Yet existing sequential Incremental IDR/QR LDA (s-QR/IncLDA) can only process data one sample after another. This paper proposes a constructive chunk Incremental IDR/QR LDA (c-QR/IncLDA) for multiple data samples incremental learning. Given a chunk of s samples for incremental learning, the proposed c-QR/IncLDA increments current discriminant model \$\Omega\$, "
