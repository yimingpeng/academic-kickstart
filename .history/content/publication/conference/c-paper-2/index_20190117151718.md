abstract = "Reinforcement learning aims at solving stochastic sequential decision making problems through direct trial-and-error interactions with the learning environment. In this paper, we will develop generalized compatible features to approximate value functions for reliable Reinforcement Learning. Further guided by an Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning paradigm, we will also develop a generalized updating rule for policy gradient search in order to constantly improve learning performance. Our new updating rule has been examined on several benchmark learning problems. The experimental results on two problems will be reported specifically in this paper. Our results show that, under suitable generalization of the updating rule, the learning performance and reliability can be noticeably improved."
